# communication-platform
Backend to a Communication platform in Python. Collaborated in a team of 4 to design, test and implement a server using Flask and HTTP. 
Features: 
1. Authentication
2. Creating Members and Channels. 
3. Messaging ability with emoticon reactions.

While this was a group projects, I was majorly responsible for the following tasks:
1. Built the messaging functionality. 
2. Built the ability to check statistics of the application (number members, channels, their interactions, status' etc.)
3. Managing tasks, timelines and creating the design documentation for the whole project.
